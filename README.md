# Butane-Config
My Butane config for home Fedora CoreOS servers, based on secureblue example.

## Todo:
- Add all the config for the server in this file (is this the recommended approach?)
    - Add .container systemD files for my containers
    - Add ZFS storage configuration
    - Figure out how I copy my data on to the server in a repeatable fashion, without exposing/storing it online
